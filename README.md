## About Data:

```
Context
High-quality financial data is expensive to acquire and is therefore rarely shared for free. Here I provide the full historical daily price and volume data for all US-based stocks and ETFs trading on the ,SP500, NYSE, NASDAQ, and NYSE MKT. It's one of the best datasets of its kind you can obtain.
